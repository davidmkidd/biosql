Revision history for BioSQL
===========================

Note: this revision history only starts at the BioHackathon 2008,
Tokyo, prior to the v1.0 release.

BioSQL core schema
------------------

version 1.0:

  o Brought sql/biosql-accelerators-pg.sql to the 1.0 schema, but
    still retired it since no-one can have been using it.

  o Updated and fixed views and functions in sql/biosqldb-views-pg.sql
    to work with 1.0 schema. Apparently this hadn't been used for a while ...

  o Retired scripts/create_mysql_db.pl. Not sure what this was ever
    useful for, and the DDL path was wrong anyway.

  o Oracle version is now under sql/biosqldb-ora for consistency.

  o Added version for Apache Derby (Java embedded RDBMS).

  o Changed license to LGPL v3.
