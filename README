This is the BioSQL distribution. BioSQL is a generic unifying schema
for storing sequences from different sources, for instance Genbank or
Swissprot.

BioSQL is meant to be a common data storage layer supported by all the
different Bio* projects, such that entries stored through an
application written in, e.g., bioperl could be re-retrieved by one
written in, e.g., BioJava.

INSTALLATION NOTES

1. Generally, the MySQL schema sources function as the basis from
which schemas for other RDBMSs are auto-generated using, as an example,

	$ scripts/transform_sql -target pg biosqldb-mysql.sql > biosqldb-pg.sql

Replace the biosqldb-mysql.sql with the DDL source you are interested in.

2. For the MySQL version to instantiate and run properly, you need to
have a very fairly recent version of MySQL installed. Minimum
requirement is MySQL 3.23.50, because only from that version on
nullable columns which participate in a UK are handled largely
bug-free (at this point according to the MySQL documentation).

3. The Oracle version so far is separate from this in
   sql/biosql-ora. Check for a README and INSTALL document in that
   directory.
