This is the BioSQL distribution. BioSQL is a generic unifying schema
for storing sequences from different sources, for instance Genbank or
Swissprot.

BioSQL is meant to be a common data storage layer supported by all the
different Bio* projects, Bioperl, Biojava, Biopython, and Bioruby.
Entries stored through an application written in, say, Bioperl could
be retrieved by another written in Biojava.

There are currently three different RDBMSs supported: MySQL,
PostgreSQL, and Oracle. The MySQL schema DDL is in
sql/biosqldb-mysql.sql, the PostgreSQL schema is in 
sql/biosqldb-pg.sql, and the Oracle schema is in multiple files
in the directory sql/biosql-ora. In order to instantiate the schema, feed
the respective file or files to your SQL shell (mysql for MySQL, and psql for
PostgreSQL).

======================================================================
INSTALLATION NOTES

Generally, the support for each RDBMS is maintained individually,
as there are too many differences between the RDBMSs for automatic
generation from a single DDL. Please see the INSTALL for details.

POST v1.0 TODO
======================================================================

The following changes are scheduled for the next release of
BioSQL. These changes incur incompatibilities with the 1.0 version and
will require a database migration.

  - Rename comment table to anncomment and rename term_synonym.synonym
  to term_synonym.name in mysql and pg schemas. This will make the
  names consistent with the Oracle schema, avoiding Oracle reserved
  words.
