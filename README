This is the BioSQL distribution. BioSQL is a generic unifying schema
for storing sequences from different sources, for instance Genbank or
Swissprot.

BioSQL is meant to be a common data storage layer supported by all the
different Bio* projects, Bioperl, Biojava, Biopython, and Bioruby.
Entries stored through an application written in, say, Bioperl could
be retrieved by another written in Biojava.

INSTALLATION NOTES

1. Generally, the MySQL schema sources are the basis for the other
RDBMS schemas. For example, the Postgres SQL is made like this:

 $ scripts/transform_sql -target pg biosqldb-mysql.sql > biosqldb-pg.sql

Replace the biosqldb-mysql.sql with the DDL source you are interested in.

2. For the MySQL version to instantiate and run properly you need to
have a very fairly recent version of MySQL installed. Minimum
requirement is MySQL 3.23.50, because only from that version on are
nullable columns which participate in a UK handled in a bug-free 
manner (according to the MySQL documentation).

3. The Oracle version is maintained separately, in sql/biosql-ora. 
Check for a README and INSTALL document in that directory.
