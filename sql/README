There are currently three different RDBMSs supported: MySQL,
PostgreSQL, and Oracle.

The MySQL schema DDL is in biosqldb-mysql.sql, and the PostgreSQL
schema is in biosqldb-pg.sql. In order to instantiate the schema, feed
the respective file to you SQL shell (mysql for MySQL, and psql for
PostgreSQL).

The Oracle schema is in the directory biosql-ora; check out the
INSTALL documentation in that directory for how to instantiate it.

You may also want to read other documentation that comes with this
distribution, like the INSTALL and README files in the distribution's
root directory.
