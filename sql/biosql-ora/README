======================================================================
This directory tree contains the Oracle version of the BioSQL schema.
======================================================================

The Oracle version presently is decoupled from the other RDBMSs so far
supported. This is for several reasons.

   - The Oracle version is richer. It comes with triggers, a complete
     API as views and PL/SQL packages, materialized views, and context
     indexes.

   - The creator of the Oracle version uses a completely different
     naming convention than the original creators of BioSQL
     use. Given the ability to create views and synonyms, it is not
     necessary to sacrifice naming conventions to achieve
     compatibility.

For installation instructions read the INSTALL document. See LICENSE
for the license terms under which you may use biosql-ora.
